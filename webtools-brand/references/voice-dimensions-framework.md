# Voice Dimensions Framework

**Purpose:** Reference framework for scoring and defining brand voice across 15 dimensions. Used by the brand-voice-creator agent to produce structured, comprehensive D2: Brand Voice Profiles.

---

## How to Use This Framework

Each dimension has a spectrum with defined positions. During voice profiling:

- **Extract mode**: Score each dimension based on analyzed content. Cite examples.
- **Generate mode**: Walk the operator through each dimension, presenting the spectrum and asking where the brand should sit.

Score each dimension on a 1-10 scale where noted, or select the named position that best fits.

---

## FOUNDATION DIMENSIONS (1-5)

These define the core personality and communication baseline. They rarely change.

### Dimension 1: Core Voice Attributes

**What it defines:** The brand's personality expressed as measurable traits.

**Aaker Brand Personality Framework:**

| Trait | Scale | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Sincerity | 1-10 | Honest, wholesome, genuine, down-to-earth |
| Competence | 1-10 | Reliable, intelligent, capable, successful |
| Excitement | 1-10 | Daring, spirited, imaginative, up-to-date |
| Sophistication | 1-10 | Upper class, charming, glamorous |
| Ruggedness | 1-10 | Outdoorsy, tough, strong |

**Output format:** 3-5 specific voice attributes (adjectives) with definitions and writing examples. Each attribute should map back to the Aaker scores.

**Example:**
- Sincerity: 8/10, Competence: 9/10, Excitement: 5/10 -> Attributes: "Reliable", "Genuine", "Curious"

---

### Dimension 2: Formality Spectrum

**What it defines:** The grammatical register and structural formality of all written content.

**Positions:**

| Position | Score | Grammar Rules | Example |
|----------|-------|---------------|---------|
| Very Formal | 1-2 | No contractions, complete sentences, formal grammar | "We shall be pleased to assist you in determining optimal requirements." |
| Formal | 3-4 | Minimal contractions, professional phrasing, structured | "We will work with you to define your project requirements clearly." |
| Moderate | 5-6 | Selective contractions, professional but approachable | "We'll work with you to define clear project requirements." |
| Casual | 7-8 | Contractions required, conversational grammar, conjunctions at start | "We'll figure out exactly what you need. Let's start with discovery." |
| Very Casual | 9-10 | Fragments OK, ultra-conversational, slang acceptable | "Discovery phase? Game changer. Here's why." |

**Decision factors:**
- Brand archetype (see Dimension: Archetypes)
- Target audience expectations
- Industry norms (and whether to match or break them)
- Competitive differentiation opportunity

**Grammar rules to define at each level:**
- Contractions (required / allowed / avoided)
- Sentence fragments (OK / occasional / never)
- Starting sentences with conjunctions (yes / no)
- Active vs passive voice ratio target
- Oxford comma (yes / no)
