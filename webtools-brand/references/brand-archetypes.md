# Brand Archetypes Reference

**Purpose:** Reference guide for the 12 brand archetypes used during voice profiling. Helps operators identify their brand's personality mix and understand how archetype choices affect voice dimensions.

## How Archetypes Work in Voice Profiling

Brand archetypes are personality patterns that shape how a brand communicates. Most brands are a **mix of 2-3 archetypes** with weighted percentages. The primary archetype drives the dominant voice, while secondary archetypes add nuance.

**During profiling:**
1. Present the 12 archetypes with brief descriptions
2. Ask the operator to identify which 2-3 resonate most
3. Assign percentage weights (must total 100%)
4. Use the archetype mix to inform decisions across all 15 voice dimensions

## How to Present Archetypes During Profiling

### Extract Mode

After analyzing content, identify which archetypes are present:

```
Based on the analyzed content, the brand voice aligns with:

Primary: [Archetype] ([X]%) -- [evidence from content]
Secondary: [Archetype] ([X]%) -- [evidence from content]
Accent: [Archetype] ([X]%) -- [evidence from content]

This creates a [Combination Name] voice pattern.
Does this match your intent, or should we adjust the mix?
```

### Generate Mode

Present archetypes in groups and let the operator react:

```
Let's identify the brand's personality. Which of these groups resonates most?

Group A - Authority & Expertise: Sage, Ruler, Hero
Group B - Warmth & Connection: Caregiver, Everyman, Innocent
Group C - Innovation & Energy: Creator, Explorer, Magician
Group D - Boldness & Personality: Rebel, Jester, Lover

Most brands pick one from two different groups.
Which resonates? Any specific archetypes stand out?
```
