# Channel Adaptation Template

**Purpose:** Reference template for mapping brand voice across communication channels. Used by the brand-voice-creator agent to define how each voice dimension shifts by channel in the D2 output.

---

## Core Principle

The brand voice has a **baseline** defined by the 15 dimensions. Channels shift specific dimensions up or down from that baseline while the core personality stays constant.

**What NEVER changes across channels:**
- Core personality attributes (Dimension 1)
- Power dynamic (Dimension 4)
- Core values

**What SHIFTS by channel:**
- Formality level (up or down from baseline)
- Humor amount and type
- Energy level
- Information density
- Content structure

---

## Channel Tone Map Template

Use this table to document how the brand voice adapts per channel. Shifts are relative to the baseline defined in Foundation dimensions.

### Primary Channels

#### Website (Main Pages)

**Role:** The baseline. All other channels are defined relative to this.

| Dimension | Setting |
|-----------|---------|
| Formality | Baseline |
| Humor | Baseline |
| Energy | Baseline |
| Density | Baseline |
| Storytelling | [Primary framework from Dim 7] |
| Key priority | [e.g., Professional warmth, clear value proposition] |

**Content types:** Homepage, about, services, landing pages, pricing
**Typical length:** Medium (300-800 words per page section)
**Example tone note:** [Insert example sentence in baseline voice]

---

#### Blog / Articles

**Role:** Deeper content, more personality than main pages.

| Dimension | Shift from Baseline |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Formality | Same or -1 (slightly more casual) |

| Energy | +1 (more enthusiasm for topic) |
| Density | +1 (more detailed, deeper dives) |

**Typical length:** Long (800-2000 words)

## Anti-Boring Standards Per Channel

Each channel has a minimum anti-boring requirement:

| Channel | Minimum Anti-Boring Elements |
|---------|------------------------------|
| Website (main) | 1 per section: unexpected comparison, surprising stat, or pattern interrupt |
| Blog | 2+ per post: provocative hook, contrarian insight, specific data, vivid example |
| Social | Every post: the hook IS the anti-boring element |
| Email (marketing) | 1 per email: curiosity gap subject line, unexpected opening, or surprising data |
| Email (support) | 0: clarity takes absolute priority |
| Documentation | 0: accuracy and findability take priority |
| Crisis | 0: seriousness and transparency take priority |
| Proposals | 1: differentiated opening or unexpected insight about client's situation |
