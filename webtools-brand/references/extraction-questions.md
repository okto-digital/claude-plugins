# Extraction Questions Reference

**Purpose:** POINTED extraction questions organized by voice dimension. Used by the brand-voice-creator agent to extract deep, specific voice insights from operators and existing content -- never vague, always targeted.

---

## The POINTED Principle

**POINTED questions** extract specific, actionable voice information. **VAGUE questions** produce generic, useless answers.

**POINTED:** "What would your brand NEVER say, even if it were true?"
**VAGUE:** "How do you want your brand to sound?"

**POINTED:** "If your brand were at a networking event, would it be the one telling stories at the center, having a quiet 1-on-1 in the corner, or cracking jokes at the bar?"
**VAGUE:** "What's your brand personality?"

**Rules:**
- Every question references something concrete (a scenario, an example, a comparison)
- Every question can only be answered with specific detail, not platitudes
- Questions work in pairs: one for Extract mode (analyzing content), one for Generate mode (co-creating)

## FOUNDATION DIMENSIONS

### Dimension 1: Core Voice Attributes

**Extract mode (analyzing existing content):**
1. "Looking at [specific page], the tone feels [X]. Is that intentional or has it drifted from what you want?"
2. "These three phrases from your content -- [A], [B], [C] -- project different personalities. Which one is closest to the real you?"
3. "Your about page sounds [adjective] but your service pages sound [different adjective]. Which is the 'real' voice?"
4. "If I read your homepage to someone with no context, what three words would they use to describe the company? Are those the right three words?"
5. "Which competitor's tone makes you think 'I wish we sounded like that'? What specifically about it?"

**Generate mode (co-creating from scratch):**
1. "If your brand were a person at a dinner party, how would other guests describe them after they left?"
2. "What would your brand NEVER say, even if it were true?"
3. "Name a brand whose communication style you admire -- from any industry. What specifically do you like about how they talk?"
4. "If a customer described working with you to a friend, what three words would you want them to use?"
5. "Imagine your brand writes a social media post that goes viral. What made it resonate -- humor, insight, vulnerability, boldness, or something else?"

### Dimension 2: Formality Spectrum

**Extract mode:**
1. "Your website uses [contractions / no contractions]. Is that a deliberate choice or just how it came out?"
2. "This sentence from your site -- '[quote]' -- would you describe it as too formal, too casual, or just right?"
3. "Your emails to clients sound [formal/casual] while your website sounds [different]. Which register do you actually want?"
4. "When you write a message to a prospective client, do you start with 'Dear', 'Hi', 'Hey', or something else? Why?"
5. "Do you use contractions when writing to clients? (We'll, you're, it's) Or does that feel too informal?"

**Generate mode:**
1. "Read these two sentences and tell me which feels more 'you': [formal version] vs [casual version]"
2. "When a new client emails you for the first time, how do you reply? Show me an actual recent email opening line."
3. "If your website could either sound like a polished brochure or a knowledgeable friend explaining something -- which feels right?"
4. "Is there a level of casualness where it starts to feel unprofessional for your industry? Where's that line?"
5. "Would your ideal customer trust you MORE if you sounded polished and formal, or relaxed and approachable?"

### Dimension 3: Language Style

**Extract mode:**
1. "Your content uses [specific technical term] without explaining it. Is your audience expected to know this, or should it be simpler?"
2. "I found these corporate buzzwords in your copy: [list]. Are any of them intentional or do they feel generic?"
3. "Your reading level scores at [grade level]. Is that deliberate or higher/lower than intended?"
4. "You use the word '[word]' [X] times across your site. Is that a brand signature or accidental repetition?"
5. "Are there specific words or phrases that feel uniquely 'yours'? Words you naturally gravitate toward?"

**Generate mode:**
1. "Name 5 words you'd love to see on every page of your website."
2. "Name 5 words that make you cringe when you see them in your industry."
3. "If you had to explain your core service to your neighbor with zero industry knowledge, how would you say it?"
4. "How technical is your audience? Can you use terms like [industry term] without explanation, or do you need to define everything?"
5. "Do you want your content to sound smart-but-accessible or deliberately simple? There's a big difference."
6. "What words do your competitors overuse that you want to actively avoid?"

---

### Dimension 4: Perspective & Relationship

**Extract mode:**
1. "Your homepage says 'we' [X] times and 'you' [Y] times. Does that ratio feel right -- is it too self-focused or too deferential?"
2. "This paragraph positions you as the expert telling the client what to do: '[quote]'. Is that the dynamic you want, or should it be more collaborative?"
3. "Your case studies say 'We delivered X' rather than 'They achieved X with our help.' Is the brand the hero or the guide in these stories?"
4. "When clients describe working with you, do they say 'They built our site' or 'We built our site together'? Which framing do you prefer?"
5. "Your support docs use 'users should' language. Is that intentional authority or would 'you can' feel better?"

**Generate mode:**
1. "When a client has a problem, do you want to sound like: (a) the expert with the answer, (b) the partner who'll figure it out together, or (c) the supportive guide who teaches them to solve it?"
2. "Should your website talk more about what YOU do, or more about what the CLIENT gets?"
3. "Do you want clients to feel like they're hiring an authority, a partner, or a trusted friend?"
4. "Are you the protagonist of your own story, or is the client the protagonist and you're the guide?"

4. "The overall energy feels [energetic/calm/flat]. On a scale of 'zen garden' to 'rock concert', where should your brand sit?"
5. "Your about page is very factual -- no emotional language. Would adding warmth feel authentic or forced?"

**Generate mode:**
1. "Should reading your website feel like: (a) talking to a smart friend, (b) reading a trusted magazine, (c) attending an inspiring talk, or (d) getting expert advice from your doctor?"

## Question Selection Strategy

Do NOT ask all 80+ questions. Select based on mode and context:

**Extract mode (with existing content):**
- Ask 2-3 questions per dimension where content shows clear patterns
- Skip dimensions where content provides obvious answers
- Focus questions on inconsistencies and ambiguities
- Total: 15-25 questions across the session

**Generate mode (from scratch):**
- Ask 2-3 questions per Foundation dimension (most important)
- Ask 1-2 per Expression and Context dimension
- Ask 1-2 per Strategic dimension
- Total: 20-30 questions across the session

**General rules:**
- Batch questions (3-5 at a time, grouped by theme)
- Build on previous answers (reference what operator already said)
- Skip questions that earlier answers already resolved
- Always end with: "Is there anything about how your brand should communicate that we haven't covered?"

---

**These questions produce specific, actionable insights. Never settle for vague answers -- follow up with "Give me a specific example" or "Show me where on your site."**
