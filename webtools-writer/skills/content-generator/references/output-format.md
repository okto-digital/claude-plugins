# Output Format

Shared output structure for content generated by this skill. Both modes produce the same content body structure but use different frontmatter and file naming.

---

## File Naming

### Blueprint Mode

```
content/D8-content-{page-slug}.md
```

The `{page-slug}` must match the slug from D4 and the corresponding D7 blueprint exactly.

### Brief Mode

```
content/generated-{slug}.md
```

The `{slug}` comes from the brief's YAML frontmatter `slug` field. If the brief filename is `content-brief-services.md`, the slug should be `services` and the output is `generated-services.md`.

---

## Frontmatter

### Blueprint Mode

```yaml
---
document_id: D8
document_type: page-content
title: "Page Content: [Page Name]"
project: "[client name]"
created: [today]
updated: [today]
created_by: webtools-writer
status: complete
dependencies:
  - D7: /blueprints/D7-blueprint-{slug}.md
  - D2: /brand/D2-brand-voice-profile.md
---
```

Include D3, D12, D6 in dependencies if they were loaded and used.

### Brief Mode

```yaml
---
document_type: generated-content
title: "Generated Content: [Page Name]"
meta_title: "[suggested title tag]"
meta_description: "[suggested meta description]"
source_brief: content/content-brief-{slug}.md
project: "[client name]"
created: [today]
updated: [today]
created_by: webtools-writer
status: generated
---
```

---

## Content Body Structure

Both modes produce the same body structure:

### Page Metadata

At the top of the body (after frontmatter):

- Suggested title tag
- Suggested meta description
- Suggested H1

### Content Sections

Each section matching the source outline order:

- Section heading (H2 or H3 as specified)
- Body content (formatted markdown)
- CTA text (if applicable)
- Alt text suggestions (if applicable)
- Designer/developer notes (if applicable)

### Content Statistics

At the end of the document:

```
## Content Statistics

- Total word count: [count]
- Sections flagged for client input: [list or "none"]
- Keyword summary: [if keyword targets were available, brief placement note; otherwise "No keyword targets applied"]
```

---

## Overwrite Protection

Before writing, check if the output file already exists. If yes, warn and ask the operator whether to overwrite or cancel.
