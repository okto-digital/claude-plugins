**Communication Principles:**

- ✓ "We made a mistake in yesterday's deployment that affected your checkout flow. Here's what happened, how we fixed it, and what we're doing to prevent it from happening again. We're really sorry."
- ✗ "Whoops! Server's down. We're on it. Sorry folks!" (too casual)

---

### STRATEGIC DIMENSIONS

#### 13. Content Principles

**Content Focus:** Balanced Mix (Product + Customer + Insights)

- Teach how things work (process/insights)

- Open about process and learnings
- Selective about specifics (protect client confidentiality)
- Honest about challenges without oversharing

**Proof Style:** Hybrid (Process + Story, data when available)
- Show HOW you work (process explanations)
- Share client stories and narratives

**Tone of Claims:** C+ (Collaborative with Confidence)

**Topic Depth:** Varies by Channel

- Social media: Punchy, don't overthink

**Content Attitude:** Mix (Opinionated on social, Educational elsewhere)
- Social media: Hot takes, opinions, challenge norms

- Examples:
  - Social: "Most agencies rush to code without understanding the problem. Shocking how often this ends badly."
  - Client: "Here's our discovery process and why each step prevents costly rebuilds later."

---

#### 14. B2B vs. B2C Positioning

**Approach:** B+ (Humanized B2B with Personality)

Personality-forward B2B that stands out while staying credible. Leans toward casual/human but maintains business appropriateness.

**DO:**
- Lead with personality and warmth in all communications
- Use "Let's build something great" not "We'd love to discuss opportunities"
- Heavy you/we usage, minimal corporate speak
- Show real humans behind the business (team bios with personality)
- Dark humor and opinions on social media (full Jester moments)
- Friend-to-friend tone in emails after relationship established
- Use analogies and direct language

**DON'T:**
- Start cold emails with "Hey!" (too casual for first contact)
- Use overly casual language in proposals
- Abandon professionalism entirely
- Treat every touchpoint like consumer brand

**Strategic Advantage:**
Most B2B competitors use safe, forgettable "professional warmth." You stand out with personality while maintaining credibility.

**Examples:**
- ✓ "Let's build something that actually works for your business. We'll start with discovery - think of it like mapping the route before the road trip."
- ✗ "We'd love to work with you. Let's start with discovery to understand your needs." (too safe)
- ✗ "Hey! Let's build something awesome together. Hit me up!" (too casual)

---

#### 15. Voice Evolution

**Constants (NEVER change):**
- Reliable, Genuine, Curious personality
- Casual formality
- Peer/Friend power dynamic
- Educational storytelling approach

**What CAN evolve:**
- Execution quality
- Content depth
- Channel sophistication
- Team size (10 → 25)

**Evolution Trigger:**
Only major market shift (enterprise focus or AI specialization) would require voice reassessment.

**Current Path (SMB custom development):**
All 15 dimensions stay constant. Voice maturity = consistency and polish, not personality change.

**10 years from now:**
Still Casual, still Genuine, still teaching, still Peer/Friend.
