## A. Technical Content Questions

### For Tool/Technology Recommendations

**POINTED:**

**VAGUE (NEVER use):**
- "How do you do this differently?"
- "What's your technical approach?"

## B. Process Content Questions

### For Process Steps

**POINTED:**
- "Article outlines [X] steps for [process]. Walk me through okto-digital's EXACT steps - are there more? Fewer? What's different and why?"
- "They recommend starting with [A]. Do you start with [A] or [B]? Tell me about a recent project where you did this and what happened."
- "Research says step [X] takes [timeframe]. What's YOUR typical timeline and what factors affect it?"

**VAGUE (NEVER use):**
- "What's your process?"
- "How do you approach this?"
- "Do you have a methodology?"

### For Workflows

**POINTED:**
- "This workflow includes [specific elements]. Does yours include these? What do you add? What do you skip? Give me an example from a recent project."
- "Author emphasizes [X] before [Y]. Do you follow this order or flip it? Why? What have you learned works better?"
- "They allocate [X]% effort to [stage]. What's your typical allocation? Have you found different ratios work for certain types of projects?"

## C. Case Study/Example Questions

### For Client Situations

**POINTED:**
- "This example is from [industry] client with [problem]. Do you have a client in [similar industry]? What were the specifics of their situation?"
- "Author's client had [problem] and achieved [result]. What's a comparable problem you solved? Walk me through the solution and actual results."
- "Research shows [outcome/metric]. What's a real okto-digital client result that compares? Actual numbers if possible, or percentage improvements?"

**VAGUE (NEVER use):**
- "Do you have similar clients?"
- "Can you share examples?"
- "Have you done this before?"

### For Problem-Solution Patterns

**POINTED:**
- "Article describes [specific problem]. Have you encountered this exact problem? What client had it, what made it challenging, and how did you solve it?"
- "They solved [X] with [Y]. When you faced [X], did [Y] work, or did you need a different approach? Tell me about the specific client situation."
- "This case took [timeframe]. When you've done similar projects, what's your typical timeline? What factors speed it up or slow it down?"

## D. Recommendation/Advice Questions

### For Best Practices

**POINTED:**
- "Article says to avoid [X]. Do you agree? Have you seen cases where [X] actually worked or where avoiding it backfired?"
- "They recommend [specific tactic]. Does okto-digital do this? If yes, what's your twist that makes it work better? If no, what do you do instead?"
- "Author prioritizes [A] over [B]. What does okto-digital prioritize and why? Give me an example where this priority made the difference."

**VAGUE (NEVER use):**
- "What's your take on this?"
- "Do you follow best practices?"
- "What do you recommend?"

### For Strategic Decisions

**POINTED:**
- "Research suggests [specific strategy]. Have you tried this? What happened? Would you recommend it for [client type], or is there a better approach?"
- "They warn against [X]. Have you learned this the hard way, or have you found [X] can work in certain situations? Give me a real example."
- "Article advocates [position]. Where do you stand? What client experience shaped your perspective?"

## E. Industry Trend Questions

### For Trends/Predictions

**POINTED:**
- "Article predicts [trend]. Are you seeing this with your clients? Give me a specific recent conversation or project where this came up."
- "They claim [X] is becoming standard. Are your clients asking for this? What percentage? What are they actually saying?"
- "Research shows [shift]. How is this affecting okto-digital's projects? Tell me about a recent client whose needs reflect this shift."

**VAGUE (NEVER use):**
- "What trends are you seeing?"
- "Do you agree with industry predictions?"
- "What's your take on where things are going?"

## Example Transformation Walkthrough

### Source Research (Generic Article)

**Title:** "5 Steps to Successful Software Development"

**Key Points:**
1. Gather requirements from stakeholders
2. Create technical specifications
3. Develop iteratively with sprints
4. Test thoroughly before launch
5. Maintain and update regularly

**Generic Example:** "Company X used these steps and improved efficiency by 30%"

### Pointed Questions Asked

1. **Process:** "Article outlines 5 steps. Walk me through okto-digital's EXACT steps for custom software projects - are there more? Fewer? What's different?"

2. **Discovery Phase:** "They mention 'gather requirements' as step 1. Tell me about your discovery phase - what specific things do you do that aren't just 'gathering requirements'?"

3. **Client Example:** "Do you have a recent client where your process made a measurable difference? What were the specifics - industry, problem, how your approach helped?"

4. **What You Skip:** "Looking at their 5 steps, is there anything they emphasize that you've found you can skip or do differently? Give me an example project."

### Transformed Content (Unique okto-digital Perspective)

**Title:** "Why We Add a Discovery Phase Before Requirements (And You Should Too)"

**Body:**

Most software development processes start with "gather requirements." But we've learned that's where projects go wrong.

**Here's why:** Requirements assume you already understand the problem. But what if the problem isn't what the client thinks it is?

**Our process includes 6 phases, not 5, and we start with discovery:**

**1. Discovery Phase (Before Requirements)**
This isn't requirements gathering - it's business problem understanding:
- Understand business model deeply
- Map current workflow (we literally shadow the team)
- Identify real pain points (not just wish lists)
- Determine if software is actually the solution

Example: Manufacturing client wanted custom inventory system ($50K+ project). Discovery revealed their problem was manual processes, not inventory tracking. We automated existing tools first, solved the problem for $8K.

**What Changed:**

+ **Generic "gather requirements" -> Specific okto-digital discovery process**
+ **Abstract "Company X" example -> Real okto-digital client (manufacturing, e-commerce)**
+ **5 generic steps -> 6 okto-digital phases with reasoning**
+ **Corporate tone -> Casual, genuine, down-to-earth okto-digital voice**
