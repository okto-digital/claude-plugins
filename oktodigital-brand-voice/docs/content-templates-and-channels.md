## Content Type Templates

Structured formats for common content types, enhanced with anti-boring principles.

### Blog Post Structure
1. **Pattern-Breaking Hook** - Challenge assumption, present paradox, or start with unexpected angle
   - Example: "Most companies get discovery wrong by doing too much of it."
2. Context/Problem explanation (with surprising data or comparison)
3. Solution/Insight (okto-digital perspective with contrarian element)
4. Concrete examples (real client situations with specific numbers, anonymized)
5. Actionable takeaway (specific, not generic advice)
6. Optional CTA (avoid predictable "Contact us today")

### Service Page Structure
1. **Provocative Headline** - Challenge status quo or present unexpected benefit
   - NOT: "Custom Software Development Services"
   - YES: "Software That Users Actually Want to Use"
2. Problem acknowledgment (specific pain, not generic)
3. Solution overview (what makes okto-digital's approach different)
4. Process breakdown (unexpected elements in familiar process)
5. Why it matters (quantified business impact)
6. Social proof (specific result, not vague praise)
7. CTA (action-focused, not generic)

### Social Media Post Structure
1. **Attention-Arresting Hook** - Contrarian take, surprising stat, or pattern interrupt
   - Example: "We deleted half our features and usage went up 73%"
2. Value/insight (specific, unexpected angle)
3. Concrete proof point (number, example, comparison)
4. Engagement prompt (thought-provoking, not generic)

### Case Study Structure
1. **Start with the Result** - Lead with the surprising outcome
   - Example: "43% increase in conversions from removing a form field"
2. Client context (industry, specific challenge, anonymized)
3. Plot twist (what everyone else was doing wrong)
4. Okto-digital approach (why we zagged when others zigged)
5. Process (focusing on unexpected discoveries)
6. Results (specific metrics, surprising insights)
7. Client quote (capturing the "aha" moment)

### Email Campaign Structure
1. **Subject Line** - Curiosity gap or specific benefit (avoid clickbait)
2. **Opening** - Personal, relevant hook (not "Dear valued customer")
3. **Body** - One key message, conversational tone, scannable format
4. **CTA** - Single clear action, benefit-focused button text
5. **Sign-off** - Warm, genuine, on-brand

### Ad Copy Structure
1. **Headline** - Specific benefit or provocative claim (max 30 chars for search)
2. **Description** - Support headline with proof point or detail
3. **CTA** - Action verb + benefit ("See How" over "Learn More")
