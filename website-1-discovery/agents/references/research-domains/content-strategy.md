## Tools

**Required:** WebSearch, WebFetch
**Optional MCP:** `mcp__dataforseo__dataforseo_labs_google_keyword_ideas` (content topic discovery with search volume), `mcp__dataforseo__dataforseo_labs_google_related_keywords` (related content topics and semantic clusters)
**Crawling:** web-crawler dispatch for top-ranking pages (Step 2) and competitor blog sections (Step 3)

**IMPORTANT:** This answers "what kind of content should the client produce?" -- not "which keywords to target" (downstream SEO task) or "what do competitors specifically say" (competitor deep-dive task). Think content strategy, not content creation.

## Methodology

### Step 1: Content Type Analysis

Identify what content types rank and perform in this industry:

**If R1 is available:**
- Cross-reference R1 SERP findings -- which content types appeared in top results?
- Supplement with additional queries if needed

**If R1 is not available:**
- WebSearch 5 core service queries from D1
- For each query, note what content types appear in top 5 results

If DataForSEO `dataforseo_labs_google_keyword_ideas` is available, use it to discover content topics with search demand data.

Categorize content types found:
- Service/product pages (direct commercial)
- Long-form guides ("ultimate guide to [topic]", 2000+ words)
- Case studies / success stories
- Comparison articles ("[service A] vs [service B]")
- Tools and calculators (interactive content)
- Video content (tutorials, testimonials, explainers)
- Listicles and roundups ("top 10 [service] tips")
- FAQ / knowledge base articles
- Infographics and visual content
- Data studies or original research

Record which types appear most frequently across queries.

### Step 2: Content Depth Expectations

For top 2-3 ranking pages per core query, dispatch web-crawler and assess:

- **Word count range** -- approximate length (500-1000, 1000-2000, 2000+)
- **Section depth** -- number of H2/H3 sections, topic coverage breadth
- **Media usage** -- images, videos, infographics, tables, charts
- **Internal linking** -- links to related content, content hub structure
- **External citations** -- references, data sources, expert quotes

Determine: does thin content rank in this niche, or only comprehensive content?

**IMPORTANT:** Surface-level assessment only. Estimate word count from page structure. If crawl fails, note "inaccessible" and move on.

### Step 3: Content Frequency

Check 3-5 competitor blog/resource sections via web-crawler dispatch:

- **Publishing frequency** -- posts per month (estimate from recent dates)
- **Topic coverage** -- what subjects do they write about?
- **Content recency** -- when was the last post published?
- **Content freshness** -- do they update old content or only publish new?

Record each competitor's content activity level:
- **Active** -- posts within last 3 months, regular frequency
- **Sporadic** -- occasional posts, no consistent schedule
- **Stale** -- no posts in 6+ months
- **Absent** -- no blog or content section

**IMPORTANT:** If most competitors have stale or absent blogs, note this as a significant opportunity.

### Step 4: Content Gap Identification

Find topics and questions the market does not answer well:

- WebSearch "People Also Ask" patterns around core service topics
- WebSearch niche variations within the service area
- WebSearch "[service] common questions" and "[service] mistakes to avoid"

If DataForSEO `dataforseo_labs_google_related_keywords` is available, use it to find semantic clusters with unmet content demand.

For each potential gap:
- Is there a clear query with search volume potential?
- Are current top results thin, outdated, or off-topic?
- Could the client create superior content here?

Record 5-10 content gap opportunities ranked by estimated impact.

### Step 5: Linkable Asset Opportunities

Determine what earns links in this industry:

- WebSearch "[industry] resources" and "[industry] tools"
- WebSearch "[industry] statistics [year]" and "[industry] report"
- Note what types of content appear as referenced resources:
  - Original research or data studies
  - Free tools or calculators
  - Comprehensive guides (pillar content)
  - Infographics or visual summaries
  - Templates or downloadable resources
  - Industry directories or curated lists

Identify 3-5 linkable asset types that could work for the client.

### Step 6: Synthesize

**Detailed Findings sub-sections:**
- Content Type Performance (what types rank, with evidence)
- Content Depth Benchmarks (word count, media, structure expectations)
- Competitor Content Activity (frequency, recency, topic coverage)
- Content Gaps (topics no one covers well, with opportunity assessment)
- Linkable Asset Opportunities (what earns links in this industry)
- Evergreen vs Time-Sensitive Balance (what content has lasting value vs needs updates)
