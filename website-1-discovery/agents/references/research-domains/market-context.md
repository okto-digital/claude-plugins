## Tools

**Required:** WebSearch, WebFetch
**Optional MCP:** none
**Crawling:** web-crawler dispatch for 1-2 URLs only (industry report summaries, association pages)

**IMPORTANT:** This is the lightest research topic -- primarily WebSearch-based. Focus on breadth of context rather than depth in any single area. The goal is market framing for the proposal, not a market research report.

## Methodology

### Step 1: Industry Growth and Trends

Assess the market trajectory:

- WebSearch "[industry] market trends [year]"
- WebSearch "[industry] growth statistics [year]"
- WebSearch "[industry] market size [country/region]"

Record:
- **Market trajectory** -- growing, stable, or contracting (with evidence)
- **Growth indicators** -- revenue trends, company count trends, employment data
- **Key trends** -- what is changing in this industry? (3-5 trend bullets)
- **Source quality** -- government statistics > industry association > vendor report > blog post

**IMPORTANT:** Note source credibility for every market claim. Vendor reports often inflate growth to justify their products.

### Step 2: Regulatory and Compliance

Identify website-relevant compliance factors:

- WebSearch "[industry] regulations [country]"
- WebSearch "[industry] website requirements"
- WebSearch "[industry] compliance [year]"
- WebSearch "website accessibility requirements [country] [year]"

Record:
- **Industry-specific regulations** -- licensing display requirements, mandatory disclosures, data handling rules
- **Privacy regulations** -- GDPR, CCPA, or local equivalents affecting the website
- **Accessibility mandates** -- WCAG requirements, government accessibility laws (EAA in EU, ADA in US, BFSG in DE)
- **Professional standards** -- industry codes of conduct affecting web presence

Note which regulations are mandatory vs recommended.

### Step 3: Seasonal Patterns

Identify timing factors that affect web strategy:

- WebSearch "[industry] seasonal trends"
- WebSearch "[industry] peak season"
- Check D1/D2 for client-mentioned peak seasons

Record:
- **Peak periods** -- when does demand surge? (months, events, seasons)
- **Low periods** -- when does demand drop?
- **Implications for web strategy** -- campaign timing, content calendar, launch timing
- **Seasonal content opportunities** -- topics that spike in interest seasonally

If the industry has no clear seasonal pattern, note this explicitly.

### Step 4: Market Trends Affecting Digital Presence

Identify shifts that impact web strategy:

- WebSearch "[industry] digital transformation [year]"
- WebSearch "[industry] online trends [year]"
- WebSearch "[industry] customer expectations digital [year]"

Record:
- **Mobile shift** -- is this industry seeing increased mobile usage?
- **Video demand** -- is video content becoming expected?
- **AI adoption** -- are competitors using AI tools, chatbots, personalization?
- **E-commerce / online booking** -- is the industry moving toward online transactions?
- **Self-service** -- are customers expecting to solve problems online before contacting?
- **Social commerce** -- is social media becoming a direct sales channel?

Focus on trends that directly affect website design and functionality decisions.

### Step 5: Professional Associations

Identify relevant industry bodies:

- WebSearch "[industry] association [country]"
- WebSearch "[industry] professional body [region]"

Record:
- **Relevant associations** -- name, URL, membership requirements
- **Membership benefits for web presence** -- directory listings, certification badges, trust signals
- **Website requirements** -- do associations require members to display certain information?
- **Client membership status** -- is the client a member? (check D1/D2 for badges/logos)

### Step 6: Validate D1 Market Statements

Compare the client's market claims against external findings:

For each market statement in D1/D2:
- **Confirmed** -- external data supports the claim
- **Extended** -- external data adds nuance the client did not mention
- **Challenged** -- external data contradicts or questions the claim
- **Unverifiable** -- no external data found to confirm or deny

**IMPORTANT:** Be diplomatic in framing challenges.

### Step 7: Synthesize

**Detailed Findings sub-sections:**
- Market Trajectory (growth indicators with source quality noted)
- Regulatory & Compliance Factors (website-relevant regulations)
- Seasonal Patterns (timing factors for web strategy)
- Digital Trends (shifts affecting web presence)
- Professional Associations (relevant bodies, membership benefits)
- D1/D2 Statement Validation (confirmed, extended, challenged, unverifiable)
