# Domain: UX/UI Patterns & Benchmarks

**Document ID:** R4
**Output filename:** R4-ux-benchmarks.md
**Topic:** "UX/UI Patterns & Benchmarks"
**Wave:** 2
**Cross-topic inputs:** R2 (competitor URLs for benchmark site selection)

---

## Tools

**Required:** WebSearch, WebFetch
**Optional MCP:** none
**Crawling:** web-crawler dispatch for 3-5 benchmark site homepages and key pages (Steps 2-5)

**IMPORTANT:** This is a structural and visual audit, not a content analysis. Focus on patterns (how pages are organized, how users are guided) rather than messaging (what the copy says).

## Methodology

### Step 1: Identify Benchmark Sites

Select 3-5 sites for visual/structural audit:

**If R2 is available:**
- Pick 2-3 top-rated competitors from R2 (highest digital maturity)
- Add 1-2 best-in-class industry sites from WebSearch

**If R2 is not available:**
- WebSearch "best [industry] websites [year]"
- WebSearch "[industry] web design examples"
- WebSearch "[industry] website inspiration"
- Select 3-5 sites that represent the industry standard

**IMPORTANT:** Include at least one site outside the client's direct market for fresh perspective (e.g., a national leader if the client is local, or a related industry).

### Step 2: Page Type Inventory

For each benchmark site, dispatch web-crawler and catalog the page types present:

- Homepage
- Service/product pages (individual vs overview)
- About / team page
- Case studies / portfolio / work examples
- Blog / resources / knowledge base
- Pricing page
- Contact page
- FAQ page
- Testimonials / reviews page
- Landing pages (if discoverable)

Create a comparison matrix: which page types appear across all benchmark sites (universal) vs only some (optional).

### Step 3: Navigation and Structure Patterns

Observe across benchmark sites:

- **Navigation style** -- mega menu, simple top nav, sidebar nav, hamburger on desktop, sticky header
- **Information hierarchy** -- flat (few levels) vs deep (many sub-pages)
- **Service organization** -- single services page vs individual pages per service
- **Content hub pattern** -- blog with categories, resource library, knowledge base
- **Mobile navigation** -- hamburger menu, bottom nav, accordion, full-screen overlay
- **Footer structure** -- minimal vs comprehensive (sitemap-style)

Note which patterns appear across 3+ sites (industry standard) vs individual choices.

### Step 4: Conversion Flow Analysis

For each benchmark site, trace the conversion path:

- **Primary CTA** -- what action does the site want visitors to take? (contact, book, buy, call)
- **CTA placement** -- hero section, sticky header, inline within content, footer, floating button
- **CTA repetition** -- how many times does the CTA appear on a typical page?
- **Form complexity** -- number of fields, multi-step vs single form, required vs optional fields
- **Trust elements before CTA** -- testimonials near forms, guarantees, certifications, "no obligation" language
- **Secondary CTAs** -- newsletter signup, free resource download, chat widget

Identify the dominant conversion pattern in this industry.

### Step 5: Design Trend Indicators

Observe visual and interactive patterns:

**Visual style:**
- Color usage -- bold/branded vs neutral/minimal
- Typography -- serif vs sans-serif, bold headlines vs subtle
- Imagery -- professional photography vs stock vs illustration vs icons
- Layout -- full-width sections vs contained, white space usage
- Animation -- subtle transitions, scroll-triggered, parallax, or minimal

**Interactive elements:**
- Calculators, configurators, or interactive tools
- Before/after galleries or sliders
- Video integration (hero video, testimonial video, explainer)
- Chatbot or live chat widget
- Map integration
- Social proof widgets (review feeds, client counters)

**Trust signals:**
- Certifications and badges displayed
- Award logos
- Team photos (individual vs group)
- Client logos / partner logos
- Case study metrics (numbers, percentages, results)

Note which elements appear across 3+ sites (expected) vs individual choices (differentiating).

### Step 6: Synthesize

**Detailed Findings sub-sections:**
- Benchmark Sites Audited (list with brief description of each)
- Page Type Matrix (comparison table: which types appear where)
- Navigation Patterns (industry standard vs variations)
- Conversion Flow Patterns (dominant CTA approach with evidence)
- Design Trends (visual style, interactive elements, trust signals)
- Client Gap Analysis (how client's current site compares to benchmarks, using D1/D2 data)
