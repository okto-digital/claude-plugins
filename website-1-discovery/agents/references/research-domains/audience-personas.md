## Tools

**Required:** WebSearch, WebFetch
**Optional MCP:** none
**Crawling:** web-crawler dispatch for 2-3 community threads and 1-2 competitor testimonial pages (Step 3)

**IMPORTANT:** This is evidence-based audience research, not creative persona invention. Every segment and characteristic must be supported by at least one external source.

## Methodology

### Step 1: Extract Baseline Hypothesis

From D1 and D2, document:
- Client's stated target audience segments
- Audience signals from client website (who testimonials mention, what language case studies use)
- Any demographic or psychographic claims the client makes
- Any audience insights from the client interview (D2)

This is the **hypothesis to validate**. Label it clearly as "client-stated" throughout.

### Step 2: Industry Audience Research

Gather external demographic and behavioral data:

- WebSearch "[industry] customer demographics [year]"
- WebSearch "[industry] buyer persona [year]"
- WebSearch "[industry] user behavior statistics [year]"
- WebSearch "who buys [service]" or "typical [service] customer"

Extract and record:
- Age ranges per segment
- Professions or roles (B2B) / life stages (B2C)
- Income level indicators
- Geographic patterns
- Gender distribution (if relevant and available)

**IMPORTANT:** Note the source for every demographic claim. Industry reports and surveys are higher confidence than blog posts.

### Step 3: Community and Review Language

Discover how real customers talk about this service:

- WebSearch "[service] reviews" to find review aggregation pages
- WebSearch "reddit [service] recommendations" or "[service] advice forum"
- Dispatch web-crawler for 2-3 community threads (Reddit, Quora, Facebook groups, industry forums)
- Dispatch web-crawler for 1-2 competitor testimonial pages

Extract:
- **Problem language** -- how customers describe their problem (vs how the industry describes it)
- **Decision drivers** -- what matters most when choosing (price, quality, speed, trust, proximity)
- **Common objections** -- fears, hesitations, deal-breakers
- **Positive signals** -- what satisfied customers praise
- **Terminology gap** -- industry jargon vs customer vocabulary

**IMPORTANT:** If crawl fails for community URLs, rely on search result snippets and additional queries like "[service] common complaints" or "[service] what to look for".

### Step 4: Buyer Journey Mapping

Map the journey from awareness to decision:

**Awareness stage:**
- What queries do prospects use when they first realize they need this service?
- What triggers the search? (pain point, life event, business need)
- Content types that serve awareness: educational guides, "what is [service]" articles

**Consideration stage:**
- What comparison/evaluation queries appear?
- How do prospects narrow options? (reviews, comparisons, referrals)
- Content types that serve consideration: comparisons, case studies, FAQs

**Decision stage:**
- What final-step queries appear? (pricing, booking, "[company] reviews", "best [service] near me")
- What closes the deal? (trust signals, guarantees, free consultation)
- Content types that serve decision: testimonials, pricing pages, contact forms

### Step 5: Channel Preferences

Determine where this audience finds information:

- WebSearch "[industry] customer acquisition channels" or "how do people find [service]"
- Primary channels: Google search, social media, word-of-mouth/referrals, directories, professional networks
- Device usage: mobile vs desktop expectations for this audience type
- Social media platform preferences (based on demographic match)

### Step 6: Synthesize

Structure findings as 2-4 distinct audience segments. For each segment:

- **Segment name** (descriptive, not generic)
- **Demographics** -- age, profession/role, income, location (with source)
- **Psychographics** -- goals, pain points, decision drivers, fears (with source)
- **Journey** -- awareness trigger, consideration criteria, decision factors
- **Language** -- how they describe the problem, key phrases from reviews/community
- **Channel** -- where they look, device preference
- **Evidence strength** -- high/medium/low based on source quality

**Detailed Findings sub-sections:**
- Baseline Hypothesis vs External Evidence
- Audience Segments (2-4 segments, each with full profile)
- Buyer Journey Map (awareness, consideration, decision stages)
- Customer Language Patterns (terminology gap, decision drivers, objections)
- Channel Preferences (where this audience researches and decides)
