# Domain: Multilingual

**Purpose:** Validate that the brief addresses multi-language requirements -- which languages, translation approach, URL structure, content management per language, and regional targeting. Multilingual sites are significantly more complex than single-language sites; underestimating this leads to scope creep and maintenance headaches.

**Applicability:** Skip this entire domain if the website is single-language only. A few translated phrases or a Google Translate widget does not qualify -- this domain is for sites with full content in multiple languages.

**What to look for:**
- Which languages are needed and whether content exists in all of them
- Whether translation is professional, automated, or handled by internal staff
- How the URL structure handles multiple languages -- subdomains, directories, or parameters
- Whether content differs by language beyond translation -- region-specific offers, legal text, imagery
- What the maintenance burden is: every content update multiplied by number of languages

## Priority Definitions

- **CRITICAL:** Brief cannot be accurate without this. Must resolve before drafting.
- **IMPORTANT:** Brief will be thinner without this. Resolve in second pass if time allows.
- **NICE-TO-HAVE:** Useful depth. Surface once, accept skip.

## Question Templates

**Which languages does the website need to support?**
- Option A: Two languages -- a primary language and one secondary language (e.g., Dutch and English, or German and French)
- Option B: Three or more languages -- serving multiple markets or regions with distinct language needs

**How will the content be translated?**
- Option A: Professional translation -- a translator or agency will produce high-quality translations for all content
- Option B: Machine translation with human review -- using AI translation tools and having a native speaker review for accuracy and tone

**Should all pages exist in all languages, or will some content be language-specific?**
- Option A: Full parity -- every page is available in every language, providing a consistent experience regardless of language
- Option B: Selective -- core pages are translated in all languages, but some content (blog posts, region-specific pages) exists only in certain languages

**How should the URL structure handle multiple languages?**
- Option A: Subdirectories (example.com/en/, example.com/fr/) -- simple, single domain, good for SEO
- Option B: Separate domains or subdomains (example.fr, en.example.com) -- stronger regional targeting but more infrastructure to manage

**Who will handle translations for new content published after launch?**
- Option A: We have an internal process -- new content is translated by our team before publishing
- Option B: We need a sustainable workflow -- translation should be easy to trigger from the CMS, with reasonable turnaround times
