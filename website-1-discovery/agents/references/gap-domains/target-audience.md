# Domain: Target Audience

**Purpose:** Validate that the brief clearly defines who the website is for -- primary and secondary audiences, their needs, behaviors, and decision journeys. Without audience clarity, content tone, site structure, and feature priorities are all shots in the dark.

**What to look for:**
- Who actually visits the website vs who the client thinks visits
- What the audience needs to see or feel before they trust this business
- What hesitations or objections stop people from converting
- How different audience segments find the business today
- Whether there are secondary audiences with conflicting needs

---

## Priority Definitions

- **CRITICAL:** Brief cannot be accurate without this. Must resolve before drafting.
- **IMPORTANT:** Brief will be thinner without this. Resolve in second pass if time allows.
- **NICE-TO-HAVE:** Useful depth. Surface once, accept skip.
