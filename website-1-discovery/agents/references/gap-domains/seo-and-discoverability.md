# Domain: SEO and Discoverability

**Purpose:** Validate that the brief addresses how people will find the website -- keyword strategy, technical SEO foundations, URL structure, local search, and search intent alignment. A beautiful website that nobody can find delivers zero business value.

**What to look for:**
- Whether the client understands that SEO is a long-term strategy, not a launch feature
- What searches the target audience actually performs when looking for this kind of business
- Whether the current site (if any) has search authority worth preserving
- How local search matters -- Google Business Profile, map results, location pages
- Whether content strategy and SEO strategy are aligned or pulling in different directions

## Priority Definitions

- **CRITICAL:** Brief cannot be accurate without this. Must resolve before drafting.
- **IMPORTANT:** Brief will be thinner without this. Resolve in second pass if time allows.
- **NICE-TO-HAVE:** Useful depth. Surface once, accept skip.

## Question Templates

**How important is being found on Google for your business?**
- Option A: Very important -- organic search is or should be a primary source of new customers and leads
- Option B: Somewhat important -- most business comes through referrals or other channels, but search visibility still matters for credibility

**Do you know what people search for when looking for your type of service?**
- Option A: Yes, we have a good sense of the key terms -- for example, "[service] in [city]" or "[specific solution]"
- Option B: Not really -- we need keyword research to understand what terms our audience uses and where the opportunities are

**Does your business serve a specific geographic area?**
- Option A: Yes, we serve [city/region] and need to show up in local searches (Google Maps, "near me" queries)
- Option B: No, we serve clients regardless of location -- geographic targeting is not a priority

**Are you keeping the same domain name, or is this a new domain?**
- Option A: Same domain -- we need to preserve our existing search authority and set up redirects for any URL changes

**Do you plan to publish regular content (blog, guides, news) to attract search traffic over time?**
- Option A: Yes -- we want to invest in content marketing as a long-term organic growth strategy
