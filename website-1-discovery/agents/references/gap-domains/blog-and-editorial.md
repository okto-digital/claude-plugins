# Domain: Blog and Editorial

**Purpose:** Validate that the brief addresses regular content publishing requirements -- blog structure, editorial workflow, content types, taxonomy, and distribution strategy. A blog is not just a page; it is an ongoing content engine that needs infrastructure, process, and commitment.

**Applicability:** Skip this entire domain if no regular content publishing is planned. A static "News" page with occasional updates does not qualify -- this domain is for sites with intentional, ongoing content publishing.

**What to look for:**
- Whether the client will actually publish regularly or just wants a blog "in case"
- Who writes the content and what their realistic publishing cadence is
- How blog content connects to the business strategy -- SEO, thought leadership, or engagement
- What content types are needed beyond text: video, infographics, case studies, podcasts
- Whether a content calendar or editorial workflow exists

## Priority Definitions

- **CRITICAL:** Brief cannot be accurate without this. Must resolve before drafting.
- **IMPORTANT:** Brief will be thinner without this. Resolve in second pass if time allows.
- **NICE-TO-HAVE:** Useful depth. Surface once, accept skip.
