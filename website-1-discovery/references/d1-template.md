## Section 1: Research Findings

Assembled from web crawling, web search, and business registry lookup results. Written to `intake/research-context.md` first, then copied into D1.

---

### 1.1 Executive Summary

2-3 sentences. Cover: who (name, industry), what (core offering), who they serve, scale (headcount, revenue range, geography). No padding.

---

### 1.2 Business Identity

Use key-value and inline formats:

- **Legal name:** From business registry (or as stated on site if no registry data)
- **Trade name / tagline:** As stated on site
- **Registry ID:** Company registration number (if found)
- **Founded:** Year (from registry or site)
- **Legal form:** e.g., s.r.o., GmbH, Ltd., LLC (from registry)
- **Positioning:** Their self-description in one line
- **Services:** Comma-separated list
- **Model:** B2B | B2C | hybrid. Sales model in one phrase.
- **Revenue range:** From registry if available, otherwise omit
- **Employees:** From registry if available, otherwise from site
- **Location(s):** Registered address (registry) + service area (site)
- **Trust signals:** Certifications, awards, partnerships as comma list

If no registry data found, omit registry-specific fields (Legal name, Registry ID, Legal form, Revenue range) and note: "No business registry data available."

---

### 1.3 Website Assessment

One line per aspect. Report problems only -- skip clean items (do not report "SSL present", "responsive layout works"). Only note an item if there is something noteworthy (issue, gap, or unusual tech choice).

- **Structure:** Total pages, nav depth, primary sections
- **Content:** Blog frequency, last update, thin/deep areas
- **Tech:** CMS, frameworks, hosting clues
- **Issues:** Broken links, redirects, accessibility gaps, performance problems

Skip this section entirely if the project is a new build with no existing site.

---

### 1.4 Digital Presence

- **Social:** Comma-separated platform list
- **SEO:** One-line assessment (meta quality, heading structure, schema presence, content depth)
- **Conversion elements:** Comma-separated list of what was found (contact form, phone, chat, newsletter, etc.)
- **Analytics:** Tracking tools observed

Note: Interactive features (booking systems, live chat, configurators) may not appear in crawled content. Report what IS found; flag unconfirmed items as "not confirmed from static analysis."

---

### 1.5 Competitive Context

**Competitors:** One line each -- `Name (URL): positioning summary`

List 3-5 direct competitors. Add market density in one line.

**Client positioning:** `Positioning: premium|budget, specialist|generalist, local|national` + differentiation claim in one line.

If competitor search yielded no clear results, state what was searched and why results were inconclusive.

---

### 1.6 External Intelligence

Flat bullet list of notable findings only. Each bullet: `Source: finding`. Skip empty categories entirely.

Categories to check (include only those with findings):
- Recent news/press (with dates)
- Review ratings and themes
- Social presence (platforms, follower ranges)
- Job postings revealing growth/tech/strategy
- Industry rankings or awards

---

## Section 2: Domain Analysis

Assembled from 21 domain-analyst agent returns. Each domain section uses the format below. Domains are grouped into fixed headers.

### Per-Domain Section Format

```
**[Domain Name]** -- X FOUND, Y PARTIAL, Z GAP | X/Y CRITICAL resolved

Key findings:
- [FOUND/PARTIAL items with evidence, most important first]

Questions:
1. [Question text] -- [checkpoint] [CRITICAL|IMPORTANT]
2. [Question text] -- [checkpoint] [CRITICAL|IMPORTANT]

Notes: _______________________________________________________________
```

- "Key findings" lists the most relevant FOUND and PARTIAL items (not every checkpoint -- highlight what matters)
- "Questions" lists all questions generated by the domain-analyst for CRITICAL and IMPORTANT gaps
- If no questions: omit the Questions sub-section
- "Notes" provides empty space for operator notes during the interview
- If a domain has zero gaps and zero questions, compress to the summary line + "No gaps identified." + Notes line
