# Domain: Migration and Redesign

**Purpose:** Validate that the brief addresses requirements specific to rebuilding or migrating from an existing website -- content migration, URL preservation, SEO continuity, data transfer, and transition planning. Redesigns carry unique risks that new builds do not; losing search rankings, breaking bookmarks, or losing content can be more damaging than starting fresh.

**Applicability:** Skip this entire domain if this is a brand-new website with no existing site to migrate from or replace.

## Priority Definitions

- **CRITICAL:** Brief cannot be accurate without this. Must resolve before drafting.
- **IMPORTANT:** Brief will be thinner without this. Resolve in second pass if time allows.
- **NICE-TO-HAVE:** Useful depth. Surface once, accept skip.

## Question Templates

**What is wrong with the current site that is driving this redesign?**
- Option A: Primarily visual -- the design is outdated, the brand has evolved, and the site no longer represents who you are
- Option B: Primarily functional -- the site is slow, hard to update, missing features, or built on technology that is holding you back

**How much of the current site content should be migrated to the new site?**
- Option A: Most of it -- the content is still relevant and just needs reorganization and visual refresh
- Option B: Very little -- the content is outdated and we are using this redesign as an opportunity to start fresh with new messaging

**Do you have high-ranking pages on Google that we need to preserve?**
- Option A: Yes -- several pages rank well for important search terms, and losing those rankings would hurt the business
- Option B: Not really -- the current site has minimal search visibility, so we are essentially building SEO from scratch

**Are you changing platforms (e.g., from WordPress to Webflow, or Wix to WordPress)?**
- Option A: Yes -- we are moving to a new platform, which means content and functionality need to be rebuilt in the new system
- Option B: No -- we are staying on the same platform and doing a theme/design overhaul

**What is your plan for the transition from the old site to the new site?**
- Option A: Switch overnight -- take the old site down, put the new site up, and redirect everything
- Option B: Run both briefly in parallel -- launch the new site on a staging URL first, test thoroughly, then switch over with a specific cutover plan
