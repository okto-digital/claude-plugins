# Domain: Design and Brand

**Purpose:** Validate that the brief captures the visual identity requirements -- brand status, design preferences, imagery needs, typography, and responsive behavior. Design is the first impression; without clear brand direction, the design phase becomes guesswork and revision cycles multiply.

## Priority Definitions

- **CRITICAL:** Brief cannot be accurate without this. Must resolve before drafting.
- **IMPORTANT:** Brief will be thinner without this. Resolve in second pass if time allows.
- **NICE-TO-HAVE:** Useful depth. Surface once, accept skip.

## Question Templates

**Do you have an established brand identity (logo, colors, guidelines) or does this need to be created?**
- Option A: Yes, we have a complete brand identity with logo, color palette, and guidelines that the website must follow
- Option B: We have a logo but no formal guidelines -- the website design will help define the broader visual identity

**What websites do you admire visually, and what specifically do you like about them?**
- Option A: Clean, minimal sites with lots of whitespace and focused messaging -- like [competitor or industry example]
- Option B: Rich, content-forward sites with strong imagery and dynamic elements -- like [competitor or industry example]

**How important is mobile design relative to desktop?**
- Option A: Mobile-first -- the majority of our audience will visit on phones, so mobile experience is the top priority
- Option B: Equal priority -- our audience uses both, so both need to work well without one compromising the other

**Do you have professional photography of your business, team, and work?**
- Option A: Yes, we have recent professional photos that represent our brand well
- Option B: No, we will need either a photo shoot or a carefully curated stock photography approach that feels authentic

**What feeling should someone get within the first 3 seconds of landing on your site?**
- Option A: Professional trust -- "these people know what they are doing" -- clean design, credentials visible, confident messaging
- Option B: Approachable warmth -- "I would enjoy working with these people" -- friendly imagery, conversational tone, human touch
