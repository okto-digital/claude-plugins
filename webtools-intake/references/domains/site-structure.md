# Domain: Site Structure

**Purpose:** Validate that the brief addresses what pages the website needs, how they are organized, how users navigate between them, and what user flows must be supported. Site structure is the skeleton that everything else hangs on -- get it wrong and users cannot find what they need.

---

## Priority Definitions

- **CRITICAL:** Brief cannot be accurate without this. Must resolve before drafting.
- **IMPORTANT:** Brief will be thinner without this. Resolve in second pass if time allows.
- **NICE-TO-HAVE:** Useful depth. Surface once, accept skip.

## Question Templates

**What pages does your website need? Can you list them or describe the main sections?**
- Option A: A focused set of core pages -- Home, About, Services (with sub-pages per service), Contact, plus a few supporting pages like FAQ or Testimonials
- Option B: A larger content-rich site -- the above plus Blog, Case Studies, Resources, Team, Careers, and possibly location-specific pages

**How should the main navigation be organized?**
- Option A: Simple and flat -- 5-7 top-level items with minimal dropdowns, keeping navigation clean and scannable
- Option B: Structured with dropdowns -- grouped by category (e.g., Services dropdown with sub-services) to handle a larger page count

**What is the most important path a visitor should follow through your site?**
- Option A: Homepage to Services to Contact -- a direct path from awareness to conversion, typical for service businesses
- Option B: Homepage to specific content (case study, product page) to CTA -- building confidence through proof before asking for action

**Do you need a search function on the site?**
- Option A: No -- the site is small enough that good navigation handles everything
- Option B: Yes -- you have enough content (blog posts, products, resources) that visitors will need to find specific items

**Will you have location-specific pages (e.g., one page per city or region you serve)?**
- Option A: No -- you serve your whole area from one location and do not need separate pages
- Option B: Yes -- you serve multiple locations and need dedicated pages for each (important for local SEO)
