# Domain: Forms and Lead Capture

**Purpose:** Validate that the brief addresses how the website captures leads and facilitates contact -- form design, CTAs, lead flow, CRM integration, and follow-up automation. For most business websites, form submissions are the primary conversion event. Getting this wrong means lost leads.

## Priority Definitions

## Question Templates

**What is the primary way you want visitors to get in touch?**
- Option A: A contact form -- visitors fill out their details and inquiry, and your team follows up by email or phone
- Option B: Direct contact -- phone call or email link as the primary action, with a form as a fallback for after-hours inquiries

**What information do you need to collect from a lead to respond effectively?**
- Option A: Basic: name, email, and a message or brief description of what they need
- Option B: Detailed: name, email, phone, company, service interest, budget range, and timeline -- so you can qualify the lead before responding

**Where should form submissions be delivered?**
- Option A: Email notification to one or more team members -- simple and immediate
- Option B: Directly into your CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.) so leads are tracked and assigned automatically

**Do you want an automated email confirmation sent to people who submit a form?**
- Option A: Yes -- a brief "thank you, we received your message and will respond within [timeframe]" email
- Option B: Not needed -- your team responds quickly enough that an automated email would feel redundant

**Do you want to capture email subscribers for a newsletter or mailing list?**
- Option A: Yes -- email marketing is part of the strategy, and we need signup opportunities throughout the site
- Option B: Not at launch -- we may add this later but it is not a priority for the initial site
