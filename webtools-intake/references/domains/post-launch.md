# Domain: Post-Launch

**Purpose:** Validate that the brief addresses what happens after the website goes live -- maintenance, content updates, hosting management, support arrangements, and monitoring. A website is not a project that ends at launch; it is a product that needs ongoing care.

**What to look for:**
- Whether the client has budgeted for ongoing maintenance or expects the site to run itself
- Who handles updates, security patches, and content changes after launch
- What the plan is when something breaks at 10 PM on a Friday
- Whether a monitoring and alerting strategy exists for uptime and performance
- How the site evolves after launch -- is there a roadmap or just ad hoc requests

## Priority Definitions

- **CRITICAL:** Brief cannot be accurate without this. Must resolve before drafting.
- **IMPORTANT:** Brief will be thinner without this. Resolve in second pass if time allows.
- **NICE-TO-HAVE:** Useful depth. Surface once, accept skip.

## Question Templates

**Who will maintain and update the website after launch?**
- Option A: Your team will handle it -- you need CMS training and documentation to be self-sufficient
- Option B: You want ongoing agency/freelancer support -- a maintenance retainer for updates, security patches, and content changes

**How often do you expect to update the website content?**
- Option A: Regularly -- weekly or monthly blog posts, news updates, or new portfolio items
- Option B: Rarely -- the site content is mostly static and changes only when services or team information changes

**Do you need post-launch support included in the project scope?**
- Option A: Yes -- include a 30-60 day support window for bug fixes and minor adjustments after launch
- Option B: No -- the project ends at launch, and any post-launch work will be scoped separately

**Who will be responsible for hosting, domain renewal, and SSL certificates?**
- Option A: We manage it ourselves -- just set it up and hand over access
- Option B: We want the agency/developer to manage infrastructure on our behalf as part of a retainer

**Do you have plans for the website beyond the initial launch (Phase 2 features, content expansion)?**
- Option A: Yes -- we see the initial launch as a foundation and plan to add features like [blog, e-commerce, member area] over the next 6-12 months
- Option B: No -- the launch scope is the complete vision for now, and we will revisit in a year or two
