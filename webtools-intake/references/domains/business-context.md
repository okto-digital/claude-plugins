# Domain: Business Context

**Purpose:** Validate that the brief captures a clear understanding of the business -- who they are, what they do, why they need a website, and what success looks like. Without solid business context, every downstream decision (design, content, architecture) is guesswork.

## Priority Definitions

- **CRITICAL:** Brief cannot be accurate without this. Must resolve before drafting.
- **IMPORTANT:** Brief will be thinner without this. Resolve in second pass if time allows.

## Question Templates

**What is the single most important thing this website needs to do for your business?**
- Option A: Generate qualified leads (form submissions or phone calls) -- since you mentioned growing your client base
- Option B: Build credibility so prospects trust you before making contact -- since you are in a high-trust industry

**How would you describe your business to someone at a networking event in one sentence?**
- Option A: "We help [target audience] solve [specific problem] through [core offering]" -- based on the services you described
- Option B: "We are the [market position] provider of [offering] for [industry/region]" -- based on your competitive positioning

**What triggered this website project right now?**
- Option A: The current site no longer reflects the business (outdated design, wrong messaging, missing services) -- since you mentioned a rebrand
- Option B: Business growth has outpaced what the current site can support (more services, new markets, higher traffic) -- since you mentioned expansion

**If the website could only achieve one measurable outcome in the first 6 months, what would it be?**
- Option A: A specific number of qualified leads per month (e.g., 20 form submissions) -- since lead generation seems to be the priority
- Option B: A measurable increase in brand search volume or direct traffic -- since market awareness appears to be the bigger gap

**Who has final sign-off on the website before it launches?**
- Option A: A single decision-maker (owner/director) who reviews and approves -- keeping the approval chain short
- Option B: A small committee (2-3 stakeholders) who each review their area of expertise -- spreading responsibility across the team
