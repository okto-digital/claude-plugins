# Domain: Project Scope

**Purpose:** Validate that the brief captures the practical project parameters -- timeline, budget, milestones, phasing strategy, and stakeholder approval process. Without clear scope, projects drift, budgets overrun, and expectations misalign.

---

## Priority Definitions

- **CRITICAL:** Brief cannot be accurate without this. Must resolve before drafting.
- **IMPORTANT:** Brief will be thinner without this. Resolve in second pass if time allows.
- **NICE-TO-HAVE:** Useful depth. Surface once, accept skip.

## 1. Timeline

| Checkpoint | Priority |
|---|---|
| Target launch date or deadline | CRITICAL |
| Is the deadline hard (event, legal, seasonal) or flexible? | IMPORTANT |
| Key milestone dates identified (design approval, content delivery, staging review) | IMPORTANT |
| Dependencies that could delay the project (content from client, third-party access, approvals) | IMPORTANT |
| Buffer time planned for revisions and unexpected issues | NICE-TO-HAVE |

## 2. Budget

| Checkpoint | Priority |
|---|---|
| Budget range established (even a broad range helps) | CRITICAL |
| Budget covers design, development, content, and hosting? Or just build? | IMPORTANT |
| Ongoing costs understood (hosting, maintenance, tools, licenses) | IMPORTANT |
| Payment structure discussed (milestone-based, upfront, retainer) | NICE-TO-HAVE |
| Budget flexibility: hard cap or range with justified overage possibility | NICE-TO-HAVE |

## 3. Phasing Strategy

| Checkpoint | Priority |
|---|---|
| Launch everything at once vs. phased approach | IMPORTANT |
| MVP / Phase 1 scope clearly defined (if phased) | IMPORTANT |
| Phase 2+ features identified and deferred explicitly | NICE-TO-HAVE |
| Criteria for moving to next phase (time, budget, performance metrics) | NICE-TO-HAVE |
| Features explicitly out of scope documented | IMPORTANT |

## 4. Deliverables

| Checkpoint | Priority |
|---|---|
| Complete list of project deliverables agreed | IMPORTANT |
| Design deliverables specified (mockups, prototypes, style guide) | IMPORTANT |
| Development deliverables specified (pages, features, integrations) | IMPORTANT |
| Content deliverables specified (copy, images, videos) | IMPORTANT |
| Training or documentation deliverables (CMS training, user guide) | NICE-TO-HAVE |

## 5. Stakeholder and Approval Process

| Checkpoint | Priority |
|---|---|
| Decision-maker identified (who gives final approval) | CRITICAL |
| Approval process defined (number of revision rounds, sign-off steps) | IMPORTANT |
| Feedback consolidation: one voice or multiple reviewers? | IMPORTANT |
| Turnaround time expectations for client feedback | IMPORTANT |
| Escalation path if stakeholders disagree | NICE-TO-HAVE |

## 6. Risks and Constraints

| Checkpoint | Priority |
|---|---|
| Known risks identified (content delays, technical unknowns, stakeholder availability) | IMPORTANT |
| Platform or technology constraints documented | IMPORTANT |
| Legal or regulatory constraints affecting timeline | NICE-TO-HAVE |
| Resource constraints (limited team, shared resources) | NICE-TO-HAVE |
| Contingency plan if timeline slips | NICE-TO-HAVE |

## Question Templates

**When do you need the website to launch?**
- Option A: We have a specific deadline -- [date or event] -- and it is not flexible
- Option B: We have a target timeframe (e.g., within 3 months) but some flexibility if needed for quality

**What is the budget range for this project?**
- Option A: Under [amount] -- we need to prioritize ruthlessly and launch lean
- Option B: [Amount range] -- we have room for a comprehensive build but still need to be smart about scope

**Do you want to launch everything at once, or in phases?**
- Option A: All at once -- we want the full site live on day one
- Option B: Phased -- launch with core pages first (MVP), then add features and content over time

**Who approves the design and content before we build?**
- Option A: One decision-maker reviews and approves -- keeping the process fast and decisive
- Option B: A small group reviews collaboratively -- feedback is consolidated by one person before delivery

**Are there any hard constraints we should know about (technology, legal, budget, timing)?**
- Option A: Yes -- [specific constraint] that limits our options and must be planned around
- Option B: No major constraints -- we have flexibility to choose the best approach for the goals
