# Domain: Accessibility

**Purpose:** Validate that the brief addresses inclusive design -- WCAG compliance targets, assistive technology support, and design considerations for users with disabilities. Accessibility is a legal requirement in many jurisdictions and a quality marker that benefits all users.

## Priority Definitions

- **CRITICAL:** Brief cannot be accurate without this. Must resolve before drafting.
- **IMPORTANT:** Brief will be thinner without this. Resolve in second pass if time allows.
- **NICE-TO-HAVE:** Useful depth. Surface once, accept skip.

## Question Templates

**What level of accessibility compliance does your website need to meet?**
- Option A: WCAG 2.1 Level AA -- the standard compliance level that covers most legal requirements and serves the widest range of users
- Option B: Basic accessibility (WCAG Level A) -- cover the essentials without the full scope of AA, typically sufficient for smaller businesses without regulatory pressure

**Are there legal or regulatory accessibility requirements for your industry or region?**
- Option A: Yes -- we operate in a regulated industry or jurisdiction with specific accessibility mandates (e.g., European Accessibility Act, ADA, Section 508)
- Option B: Not that we know of -- but we want to be inclusive and reduce legal risk regardless

**Will your site include video content that needs captions or transcripts?**
- Option A: Yes -- we plan to use video and need captions for accessibility (and SEO benefit)
- Option B: No video planned -- or minimal video where captions are not a priority at launch

**How important is keyboard-only navigation for your audience?**
- Option A: Important -- our audience may include users who rely on keyboards or assistive devices (e.g., older demographics, government/education visitors)
- Option B: Standard priority -- we want it to work but it is not a primary use case for our known audience

**Do you want an accessibility statement page on the site?**
- Option A: Yes -- it demonstrates commitment and provides a contact point for users who encounter barriers
- Option B: Not at launch -- we will focus on building an accessible site first and add the statement later
