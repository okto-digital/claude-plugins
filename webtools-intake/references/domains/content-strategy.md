# Domain: Content Strategy

**Purpose:** Validate that the brief addresses what content the website needs, who creates it, how it is structured, and what the messaging hierarchy looks like. Content is the primary reason people visit a website -- without a content strategy, design and development have nothing meaningful to frame.

## Priority Definitions

- **CRITICAL:** Brief cannot be accurate without this. Must resolve before drafting.
- **IMPORTANT:** Brief will be thinner without this. Resolve in second pass if time allows.
- **NICE-TO-HAVE:** Useful depth. Surface once, accept skip.
